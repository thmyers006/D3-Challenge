# D3-challenge
Data-Journalism and D3

Hello World! For this challenge, I take a dataset based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the
US Census Bureau and create a visualization.  The task set before me is to analyze
the current trends shaping people's lives by creating charts, graphs and interactive elements 
to help readers understand the findings.

This is the first installment.  Check back in later for additional changes.

          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death in the US, accounting
             for about 1 in 5 deaths each year.  On average, people who smoke die about 
             10 years earlier than people who have never smoked. <i>(www.cancer.org)</i></p>
            
          <p>Most people know smoking can cause cancer. But it can also cause a number of other
             diseases and can damage nearly every organ in the body, including the lungs, heart,
              blood vessels, reproductive organs, mouth, skin, eyes, and bones. <i>(www.cancer.org)</i></p>

          <p>In the U.S., people living below the poverty level and people having lower levels 
            of educational attainment have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general population. 
            <i>(cdc.gov)</i></p>

          <p>Current cigarette smoking is higher among people with a low annual household income 
            than those with higher annual household incomes.  About 21 of every 100 adults with an
            annual household income less than $35,000 (21.4%).  Nearly 16 of every 100 adults with 
            an annual household income of $35,000 to $74,999 (15.7%).  About 11 of every 100 adults
            with an annual household income of $75,000 to $99,999 (11.4%).  About 7 of every 100 
            adults with an annual household income greater than $100,000 (7.1%). <i>(cdc.gov)</i></p>
